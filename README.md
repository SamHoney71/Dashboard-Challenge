<h1> Interactive Visualizations and Dashboard Challenge </h1>
<h3> Gary Jeter </h3>

<p> This is an interactive dashboard to display samples of microbes that colonize human navals. </p>
<p> When a patient number is selected in the drop down, two charts will change. </p>
<p> Bar Chart:  Shows Top 10 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU) sample values within the patient.</p>
<p> Bubble Chart:  Shows patient's Top 10 OTU sample values in relationship to one another.  A larger bubble represents more samples collected.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> Acknowledgement:  Rama Kirshna shared his code via GitHub which I leveraged in building mine.  Andrew Perez helped me reading the samples.json file.</p>
